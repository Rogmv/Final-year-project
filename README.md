Our goal is to optimize the utilization of diverse Instruction Set Architectures (ISA) through the implementation of fine-grained scheduling, innovative migration techniques, and predictive algorithms. Heterogeneous multicore architectures have the potential to deliver high performance and energy efficiency. Such architectures can be composed of small power-efficient cores, large high-performance cores, or specialized cores that accelerate the performance of a particular computation class. However, in the process of migrating the program state from one architecture to another, the system may not be energy efficient, and peak power may also cross the threshold value.

To address this issue, our project aims to explore different machine learning-based scheduling algorithms to schedule the program on a core to reduce energy consumption. We will study this for different granularities of a program and also leverage compiler optimization techniques to achieve better results.niques to achieve better results.
